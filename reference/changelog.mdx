## Version 3.5a

### Bug Fixes

## Version 3.5

### Extended Keys Support

- Revamp extended keys support to more closely match xterm and support mode 2 as well as mode 1
- This is a substantial change to key handling which changes tmux to always request mode 2 from parent terminal
- Changes to an unambiguous internal representation of keys
- Adds an option `extended-keys-format` to control the format (similar to xterm's formatOtherKeys resource)

### Copy Mode Enhancements

- Add copy-mode -d flag to scroll a page down if in copy mode already (matching -e)
- Display hyperlinks in copy mode
- Add `copy_cursor_hyperlink` format to get the hyperlink under the cursor

- Add mirrored versions of the main-horizontal and main-vertical layouts where the main pane is bottom or right instead of top or left
- Add `prompt-cursor-colour` and `prompt-cursor-style` to set the style of the cursor in the command prompt (issue 4170)
- Add `no-detach-on-destroy` client option (issue 4242)

### Layout and Display

- Do not reset mouse pane if clicked on status line
- Clear an overlay (popup or menu) when command prompt is entered
- Send focus events to pane when entering or leaving popup (issue 3991)
- Add -y flag to disable confirmation prompts in modes (issue 4152)

### Terminal Features

- Add support for mode 2031 to automatically report dark or light theme
- tmux will guess the theme from the background colour on terminals which do not themselves support the escape sequence (issue 4353)

### Improvements

- Treat CRLF as LF in config files where it is easy to do so

- If built with systemd, remove some environment variables it uses
- Add -E flag to run-shell to forward stderr as well as stdout (issue 4246)
- Switch to getopt_long from OpenSSH (issue 4492)

### Copy and Clipboard

- Add -C and -P flags to the copy commands in copy mode:
  - -C prevents the commands from sending the text to the clipboard
  - -P prevents them from adding the text as a paste buffer (issue 4153)
- Preserve tabs for copying and capture-pane (issue 4201)
- Allow control characters to be entered at the command prompt by prefixing with C-v (issue 4206)
