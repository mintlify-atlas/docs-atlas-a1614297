This page answers frequently asked questions about tmux usage, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## General Questions

<Accordion title="What is tmux and why should I use it?">
  tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to:
  
  - Create multiple terminal sessions from a single window
  - Detach from sessions and reattach later (useful for remote work)
  - Split your terminal into multiple panes
  - Share sessions between users
  - Persist terminal sessions across SSH disconnections
  
  It's especially valuable for system administrators, developers working on remote servers, and anyone who needs to manage multiple terminal tasks simultaneously.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between a session, window, and pane?">
  tmux has three hierarchical levels:
  
  - **Session**: The top-level container. You can attach to and detach from sessions. A session contains one or more windows.
  - **Window**: Similar to tabs in a web browser. Each window has a name and fills the entire terminal. A window contains one or more panes.
  - **Pane**: A split section of a window that runs a single terminal instance. Panes divide a window into multiple sections.
  
  Hierarchy: `Session` → `Window` → `Pane`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I pronounce tmux?">
  The most common pronunciations are "tee-mux" or "tmux" (rhymes with "ducks"). Both are acceptable.
</Accordion>

## Getting Started

<Accordion title="How do I start tmux?">
  Simply run:
  
  ```bash
  tmux
  ```
  
  To create a named session:
  
  ```bash
  tmux new-session -s mysession
  # or shorthand:
  tmux new -s mysession
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I exit tmux?">
  There are several ways:
  
  - **Detach** (keeps session running): Press `C-b d` or run `tmux detach`
  - **Kill session** (destroys session): Press `C-b :` then type `kill-session`
  - **Exit shell**: Type `exit` or press `C-d` in each pane until all panes are closed
  
  Detaching is recommended as it preserves your session for later reattachment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I reattach to a session?">
  To list all sessions:
  
  ```bash
  tmux list-sessions
  # or shorthand:
  tmux ls
  ```
  
  To attach to the most recent session:
  
  ```bash
  tmux attach
  ```
  
  To attach to a specific session:
  
  ```bash
  tmux attach -t mysession
  ```
</Accordion>

## Key Bindings

<Accordion title="What is the prefix key and how do I change it?">
  The prefix key (default `C-b`, Control-b) is pressed before most tmux commands. To change it, add this to `~/.tmux.conf`:
  
  ```bash
  # Change prefix to C-a (like screen)
  unbind C-b
  set-option -g prefix C-a
  bind-key C-a send-prefix
  ```
  
  Many users prefer `C-a` as it's easier to type and matches GNU Screen's default.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I split panes?">
  - **Vertical split** (side by side): `C-b %`
  - **Horizontal split** (top and bottom): `C-b "`
  
  Many users rebind these to more intuitive keys:
  
  ```bash
  # Split vertically with |
  bind | split-window -h
  # Split horizontally with -
  bind - split-window -v
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I navigate between panes?">
  - Arrow keys: `C-b Up/Down/Left/Right`
  - Select pane by number: `C-b q` then press the number
  - Cycle through panes: `C-b o`
  - Last active pane: `C-b ;`
  
  You can also enable mouse support:
  
  ```bash
  set -g mouse on
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I resize panes?">
  - Hold `C-b` then press and hold an arrow key, or
  - `C-b C-Up/Down/Left/Right` (repeatable)
  - `C-b M-Up/Down/Left/Right` (resize by 5 cells, repeatable)
  
  Or create custom bindings:
  
  ```bash
  bind -r H resize-pane -L 5
  bind -r J resize-pane -D 5
  bind -r K resize-pane -U 5
  bind -r L resize-pane -R 5
  ```
</Accordion>

## Configuration

<Accordion title="Where is the tmux configuration file?">
  tmux looks for configuration in these locations (in order):
  
  1. `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`
  2. `~/.tmux.conf`
  
  You can also specify a config file with:
  
  ```bash
  tmux -f /path/to/config.conf
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I reload my configuration?">
  After editing your config file:
  
  ```bash
  # From within tmux:
  C-b : source-file ~/.tmux.conf
  
  # Or from command line:
  tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
  ```
  
  You can add a binding to make this easier:
  
  ```bash
  bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Config reloaded!"
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I enable true color support?">
  Add these lines to your `~/.tmux.conf`:
  
  ```bash
  set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
  set -ga terminal-overrides ",*256col*:Tc"
  ```
  
  Also ensure your outer terminal supports true color.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I enable mouse support?">
  Add to your config:
  
  ```bash
  set -g mouse on
  ```
  
  This allows:
  - Clicking to select panes
  - Dragging pane borders to resize
  - Clicking windows in status bar
  - Scrolling with mouse wheel
</Accordion>

## Copy Mode and Clipboard

<Accordion title="How do I copy text in tmux?">
  1. Enter copy mode: `C-b [`
  2. Navigate to start of text
  3. Begin selection: `Space` (vi mode) or `C-Space` (emacs mode)
  4. Navigate to end of text
  5. Copy: `Enter` (vi mode) or `M-w` (emacs mode)
  6. Paste: `C-b ]`
  
  With mouse enabled, you can also:
  - Click and drag to select
  - Double-click to select word
  - Triple-click to select line
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use vi key bindings in copy mode?">
  Add to your config:
  
  ```bash
  set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
  ```
  
  This enables vi-style navigation (h/j/k/l, w/b, etc.) in copy mode.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I integrate tmux with system clipboard?">
  On Linux with xclip:
  
  ```bash
  bind -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel 'xclip -in -selection clipboard'
  ```
  
  On macOS:
  
  ```bash
  bind -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel 'pbcopy'
  ```
  
  Or use the built-in OSC 52 support:
  
  ```bash
  set -g set-clipboard on
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I scroll with my mouse wheel?">
  If mouse mode is on but scrolling enters copy mode instead of scrolling the application:
  
  - Some applications need to enable alternate screen buffer
  - Try holding Shift while scrolling to scroll the terminal history
  - In alternate screen mode, scrolling is sent to the application
</Accordion>

## Session Management

<Accordion title="How do I switch between sessions?">
  - List sessions: `C-b s` (choose from list)
  - Switch to last session: `C-b L`
  - Switch to next session: `C-b )`
  - Switch to previous session: `C-b (`
  
  Or from command line:
  
  ```bash
  tmux switch-client -t session-name
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I rename a session or window?">
  - Rename session: `C-b $`
  - Rename window: `C-b ,`
  
  Or use commands:
  
  ```bash
  tmux rename-session -t old-name new-name
  tmux rename-window -t 0 new-name
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I prevent automatic window renaming?">
  By default, tmux automatically renames windows based on the running command. To disable:
  
  ```bash
  set-option -g allow-rename off
  set-option -g automatic-rename off
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I share a session with another user?">
  Both users can attach to the same session:
  
  ```bash
  # User 1 creates session
  tmux new-session -s shared
  
  # User 2 attaches
  tmux attach-session -t shared
  ```
  
  For read-only access:
  
  ```bash
  tmux attach-session -t shared -r
  ```
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Why do my colors look wrong?">
  Common causes:
  
  1. **Wrong TERM value**: Set in your config:
     ```bash
     set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
     ```
  
  2. **Missing terminfo**: On some systems, install `tmux-256color` terminfo
  
  3. **Outer terminal doesn't support colors**: Check your terminal emulator settings
  
  4. **No true color support**: Add terminal-overrides as shown in the configuration section
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my escape key so slow in vim?">
  tmux waits for `escape-time` to determine if Escape is part of a function key sequence. Reduce the timeout:
  
  ```bash
  set -g escape-time 10
  ```
  
  The default is already 10ms in recent versions, but older versions used 500ms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why doesn't my .bashrc / .zshrc get sourced?">
  tmux creates login shells by default. To create non-login shells:
  
  ```bash
  set -g default-command "${SHELL}"
  ```
  
  Or explicitly source your rc file in your shell's profile.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I see the tmux server log?">
  Start tmux with verbose logging:
  
  ```bash
  tmux -vv new-session
  ```
  
  The log is written to `~/tmux-client-*.log` and `~/tmux-server-*.log`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do my environment variables not update?">
  When you attach to a session, tmux preserves the environment from when the session was created. To update specific variables:
  
  ```bash
  set -g update-environment "DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY"
  ```
  
  Or manually update in a running session:
  
  ```bash
  tmux setenv -g SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run tmux inside tmux?">
  Yes, but it can be confusing. The inner tmux won't start if the `$TMUX` variable is set unless you use:
  
  ```bash
  TMUX= tmux new-session
  ```
  
  Consider using different prefix keys for nested sessions:
  
  ```bash
  bind -n C-a send-prefix  # Send C-b to inner session
  ```
</Accordion>

## Advanced Usage

<Accordion title="How do I script tmux session creation?">
  Create a script to set up your development environment:
  
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  SESSION="dev"
  
  # Create session
  tmux new-session -d -s $SESSION
  
  # Create windows
  tmux rename-window -t $SESSION:0 'editor'
  tmux new-window -t $SESSION:1 -n 'server'
  tmux new-window -t $SESSION:2 -n 'logs'
  
  # Split panes
  tmux split-window -h -t $SESSION:1
  tmux split-window -v -t $SESSION:2
  
  # Run commands
  tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:0 'vim' C-m
  tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:1 'npm run dev' C-m
  tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:2.0 'tail -f app.log' C-m
  
  # Attach
  tmux attach -t $SESSION:0
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I customize the status bar?">
  The status bar is highly customizable:
  
  ```bash
  # Status bar style
  set -g status-style 'bg=#333333 fg=#5eacd3'
  
  # Left side
  set -g status-left-length 20
  set -g status-left '#[fg=green]#S #[fg=white]| '
  
  # Right side
  set -g status-right '#[fg=white]%H:%M %d-%b-%y'
  
  # Window status
  set -g window-status-format '#I:#W'
  set -g window-status-current-format '#[bold]#I:#W'
  
  # Update interval
  set -g status-interval 60
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use tmux with SSH?">
  Common workflow:
  
  ```bash
  # SSH into server and attach/create session
  ssh user@server -t tmux attach || tmux new
  ```
  
  To automatically start/attach tmux on login, add to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
  
  ```bash
  if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    tmux attach -t default || tmux new -s default
  fi
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I run a command in all panes?">
  Enable synchronize-panes:
  
  ```bash
  # Toggle synchronization
  C-b : setw synchronize-panes
  ```
  
  Or bind to a key:
  
  ```bash
  bind S setw synchronize-panes
  ```
  
  When enabled, input is sent to all panes in the current window. The active pane border turns red by default.
</Accordion>

## Performance

<Accordion title="Can tmux handle large amounts of scrollback?">
  Yes, but large history uses more memory. The default is 2000 lines. To increase:
  
  ```bash
  set -g history-limit 10000
  ```
  
  Note that this only affects new panes. Very large values (50000+) may impact performance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does tmux work over slow connections?">
  Yes! tmux is excellent for slow or unstable connections because:
  
  - Sessions persist through disconnections
  - Only screen updates are sent (efficient protocol)
  - You can reduce status bar updates to save bandwidth:
    ```bash
    set -g status-interval 0  # Disable automatic updates
    ```
</Accordion>
