Before installing tmux, ensure you have the required dependencies:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="libevent 2.x" icon="link">
    Event notification library required for tmux operation.
    Available at: https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/latest
  </Card>
  <Card title="ncurses" icon="terminal">
    Terminal control library for managing screen output.
    Available at: https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/ncurses/
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  To build tmux from source, you'll also need: a C compiler (gcc or clang), make, pkg-config, and yacc (or bison).
</Info>

## Package Manager Installation

The easiest way to install tmux is through your system's package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tmux
```

```bash Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
sudo dnf install tmux

# On older systems use yum:
sudo yum install tmux
```

```bash Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tmux
```

```bash macOS (Homebrew)
brew install tmux
```

```bash macOS (MacPorts)
sudo port install tmux
```

```bash FreeBSD
pkg install tmux
```

```bash OpenBSD
pkg_add tmux
```

```bash NetBSD
pkgin install tmux
```

```bash Solaris
pkg install terminal/tmux
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  After installation, verify tmux is installed correctly by running `tmux -V` to check the version.
</Tip>

## Building from Source (Release)

To build and install tmux from a release tarball:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the release">
    Download the latest release tarball from the official repository:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/VERSION/tmux-VERSION.tar.gz
    tar -xzf tmux-VERSION.tar.gz
    cd tmux-VERSION
    ```
    Replace `VERSION` with the desired version number.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure and build">
    Run the configure script and build tmux:
    ```bash
    ./configure && make
    ```
    
    The configure script will check for required dependencies and configure the build for your system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install">
    Install tmux system-wide (requires root privileges):
    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Optional: Enable utempter support">
  tmux can use the utempter library to update utmp(5), if it is installed. This allows tmux to properly register terminal sessions.
  
  To enable this feature, run configure with the `--enable-utempter` flag:
  ```bash
  ./configure --enable-utempter && make
  sudo make install
  ```
</Accordion>

## Building from Git (Development)

To get and build the latest development version from version control:

<Warning>
  Building from Git requires additional tools: autoconf, automake, and pkg-config. The development version may contain unstable features.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tmux/tmux.git
    cd tmux
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate configure script">
    Run the autogen script to generate the configure script:
    ```bash
    sh autogen.sh
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure and build">
    ```bash
    ./configure && make
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install">
    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Platform-Specific Notes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Linux">
    On most Linux distributions, both libevent and ncurses are available through the package manager:
    
    **Ubuntu/Debian:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libevent-dev libncurses-dev
    ```
    
    **Fedora/RHEL:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install libevent-devel ncurses-devel
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="macOS">
    On macOS, use Homebrew or MacPorts to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    brew install libevent ncurses
    ```
    
    **MacPorts:**
    ```bash
    sudo port install libevent ncurses
    ```
    
    Xcode Command Line Tools provide the C compiler and other build tools:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="BSD Systems">
    On FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, tmux is available in the base system or ports:
    
    **FreeBSD:**
    ```bash
    # Binary package
    pkg install tmux
    
    # Or from ports
    cd /usr/ports/sysutils/tmux && make install clean
    ```
    
    **OpenBSD:**
    tmux is included in the base system on recent OpenBSD versions.

</AccordionGroup>

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that tmux is working correctly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check version">

    ```
    This should display the tmux version number.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start tmux">
