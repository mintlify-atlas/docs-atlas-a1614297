## What is tmux?

**tmux** is a terminal multiplexer that enables multiple terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. It allows you to detach from a screen and have it continue running in the background, then later reattach.

<Info>
The name "tmux" stands for **terminal multiplexer** - a tool that lets you manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.

## Key Features

### Session Management
Sessions are persistent and survive disconnection. You can:
- Create multiple named sessions
- Detach and reattach at will
- Share sessions between multiple clients
- Automatically restore your work environment

### Window and Pane Splitting
Organize your workspace efficiently:
- Split windows horizontally and vertically into panes
- Create multiple windows within a session
- Navigate between windows and panes with keyboard shortcuts
- Resize and rearrange panes to fit your workflow

### Customization
Tailor tmux to your preferences:
- Extensive configuration options
- Custom key bindings
- Scriptable commands and hooks
- Status line customization with dynamic content

### Client-Server Architecture
tmux uses a client-server model where:
- The **server** manages all sessions, windows, and panes
- **Clients** connect to view and interact with sessions
- Multiple clients can attach to the same session simultaneously
- The server continues running even when all clients disconnect

## Core Concepts

<Accordion title="Sessions">
A **session** is a collection of windows under tmux management. Each session:
- Has a unique name and ID
- Maintains its own environment and options
- Persists until explicitly destroyed
- Can have multiple clients attached

Learn more in [Sessions](/concepts/sessions).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Windows">
A **window** occupies the entire screen and contains one or more panes. Windows:
- Are numbered starting from 0 (by default)
- Have names that can be set manually or automatically
- Can be linked to multiple sessions
- Support various layout arrangements

Learn more in [Windows](/concepts/windows).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Panes">
A **pane** is a rectangular section of a window running a terminal. Panes:
- Can be split horizontally or vertically
- Each runs its own shell or command
- Can be resized, moved, and rearranged
- Support synchronized input across multiple panes

Learn more in [Panes](/concepts/panes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client-Server Model">
tmux uses a **client-server architecture** where:
- The server process manages all sessions
- Client processes connect to view/control sessions
- Communication happens over Unix domain sockets
- Multiple clients can share the same session

## Common Use Cases

### Remote Server Management
Keep long-running processes alive even when SSH connections drop:

```bash
# Start a tmux session on remote server
ssh user@server
tmux new -s work

# Run your processes
npm run dev

# Detach with Ctrl-b d
# Close SSH connection

# Later, reconnect and reattach
ssh user@server
tmux attach -t work
```

### Development Workflow
Organize your development environment with multiple panes:

```bash
# Create session for project
tmux new -s myproject

# Split into editor, server, and terminal
# Ctrl-b " (horizontal split)
# Ctrl-b % (vertical split)
```

### Pair Programming
Share a tmux session for collaborative work:

```bash
# Create a shared session
tmux new -s pairing

# Other user connects to same session
tmux attach -t pairing
```

### Monitoring and Logging
Watch multiple log files or processes simultaneously:

```bash
# Create monitoring session with multiple windows
tmux new -s monitor
tmux neww -t monitor -n logs
tmux neww -t monitor -n metrics
```

## Platform Support
