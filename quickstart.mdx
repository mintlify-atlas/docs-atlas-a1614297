## Your First tmux Session

Let's get you productive with tmux quickly. This guide covers the essential concepts and commands you'll use daily.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start tmux">
    Open your terminal and start your first tmux session:
    ```bash
    tmux
    ```
    
    You'll see a new shell prompt with a green status bar at the bottom showing:
    - `[0]` - session name
    - `0:bash*` - window number and name
    - Your hostname and time on the right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand the prefix key">
    All tmux commands start with a prefix key: `C-b` (Ctrl-b)
    
    <Info>
      Press `Ctrl` and `b` together, release both keys, then press the command key. For example, `C-b c` means: press Ctrl-b, release, then press c.
    </Info>
    
    The prefix key tells tmux: "I'm about to give you a command, not the shell."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new window">
    Press `C-b c` to create a new window.
    
    Notice the status bar now shows:
    ```
    [0] 0:bash- 1:bash*
    ```
    
    The `*` indicates your current window. The `-` marks the previous window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate between windows">
    Try these navigation commands:
    - `C-b n` - next window
    - `C-b p` - previous window
    - `C-b 0` - switch to window 0
    - `C-b 1` - switch to window 1
    - `C-b l` - toggle between current and last window
  </Step>

  <Step title="Split into panes">
    Now let's split a window into multiple panes:
    - `C-b %` - split vertically (left and right)
    - `C-b "` - split horizontally (top and bottom)
    
    Each pane is an independent terminal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate between panes">
    Move between panes:
    - `C-b o` - cycle to next pane
    - `C-b ↑` - move to pane above
    - `C-b ↓` - move to pane below  
    - `C-b ←` - move to pane on left
    - `C-b →` - move to pane on right
    - `C-b ;` - move to previously active pane
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detach from session">
    Press `C-b d` to detach from the session.
    
    You'll see a message:
    ```
    [detached (from session 0)]
    ```
    
    Your session is still running in the background! All your windows and panes are preserved.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reattach to session">
    Return to your session with:
    ```bash
    tmux attach
    ```
    
    Everything is exactly as you left it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Workflow Example

Here's a common development workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a development session">
    ```bash
    tmux new -s dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your layout">
    - Start in your project directory
    - Press `C-b %` to split vertically
    - In the right pane, press `C-b "` to split horizontally
    
    You now have three panes:
    ```
    ┌─────────┬─────────┐
    │         │         │
    │  Code   │  Tests  │
    │         ├─────────┤
    │         │  Logs   │
    └─────────┴─────────┘
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your development tools">
    - Left pane: Open your editor (`vim`, `nano`, etc.)
    - Top-right pane: Run your test watcher
    - Bottom-right pane: Tail your application logs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detach when done">
    Press `C-b d` to detach. Your session keeps running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Return later">
    ```bash
    tmux attach -t dev
    ```
    Everything is still running!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Remote Development Workflow

One of tmux's most powerful features is persistence over SSH:

<Steps>
  <Step title="SSH to remote server">
    ```bash
    ssh user@remote-server
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start or attach to tmux">
    ```bash
    # First time: create session
    tmux new -s work
    
    # Later: reattach to existing session
    tmux attach -t work
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Do your work">
    Start long-running builds, tests, or processes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disconnect safely">
    Press `C-b d` to detach, then exit SSH:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    
    Your tmux session keeps running on the server!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reconnect anytime">
    ```bash
    ssh user@remote-server
    tmux attach -t work
    ```
    
    Pick up exactly where you left off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If your SSH connection drops unexpectedly, tmux automatically detaches. Your session and all running processes continue uninterrupted.
</Warning>

## Basic Configuration

Create `~/.tmux.conf` to customize tmux:

```bash
# Change prefix from C-b to C-a (like screen)
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

# Enable mouse support
set -g mouse on

# Increase scrollback buffer
set -g history-limit 10000

# Start window numbering at 1 instead of 0
set -g base-index 1
set -g pane-base-index 1

# Renumber windows when one is closed
set -g renumber-windows on

# Improve colors
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"

# Split panes using | and -
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v
unbind '"'
unbind %

# Reload config file
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Config reloaded!"

# Vi mode for copy
set -g mode-keys vi
```

After creating or editing the config:

```bash
# Load configuration in running session
C-b : source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# Or restart tmux
tmux kill-server
tmux
```

## Common Patterns

<Accordion title="Create a session with multiple windows">
  ```bash
  # Create session with specific layout
  tmux new-session -d -s myproject -n editor
  tmux send-keys -t myproject:editor 'cd ~/myproject && vim' C-m
  
  tmux new-window -t myproject -n tests
  tmux send-keys -t myproject:tests 'cd ~/myproject && npm test' C-m
  
  tmux new-window -t myproject -n server  
  tmux send-keys -t myproject:server 'cd ~/myproject && npm start' C-m
  
  # Attach to the session
  tmux attach -t myproject
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Split window with commands">
  ```bash
  # From shell: create session with splits
  tmux new-session -d -s dev 'vim'
  tmux split-window -h -t dev 'npm test'
  tmux split-window -v -t dev 'npm start'
  tmux attach -t dev
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Share a session with another user">
  ```bash
  # User 1: Create named session
  tmux new -s pair
  
  # User 2: Attach to same session
  tmux attach -t pair
  ```
  
  <Info>
    Both users need access to the same server and tmux socket. This is useful for pair programming or collaborative debugging.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="tmux colors look wrong">
    Add to your shell configuration (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
    ```bash
    export TERM=xterm-256color
    ```
    
    And in `~/.tmux.conf`:
    ```bash
    set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't scroll with mouse wheel">
    Enable mouse support in `~/.tmux.conf`:
    ```bash
    set -g mouse on
    ```
    
    Then reload config: `C-b : source-file ~/.tmux.conf`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accidentally detached, how to reattach?">
    ```bash
    # List sessions
    tmux ls
    
    # Attach to last session
    tmux attach
    
    # Attach to specific session
    tmux attach -t session-name
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Want to close everything and start fresh">
    ```bash
    # Kill all tmux sessions and server
    tmux kill-server
    
    # Start new session
    tmux
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
